# Design

 ###  Colour Scheme
    
  - I want to go for a muted colour scheme to give the website a minimalist and contemporary feel.
   
  -  I want the muted colours to give users a relaxed feeling while browsing through the site.          This will also portray the environment of the tea rooms.
   
  - The two main colours will be sage and cream. 
    
  ### Typography
   
 -  I want the name "Sadie's" to be written in an italics style font. This will allow the company      name to stand out while giving an elegant feel to the website.
 - A font like Gilda Display will be used for the majority of the site.
    
    
 ###  Imagery
   
-  The hero image that will be used on the home page will capture the users attention instantly.      It will tell the user what to expect from the site and also what they will experience at the      tearooms.
   
-  Imagery of the tearooms will also entice the user to come and avail of the service.
